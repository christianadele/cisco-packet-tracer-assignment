# Cisco Packet Tracer: Network Simulation Project
This project is a simulation of a small business network setup using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes internal and external firewalls, VLAN segmentation, NAT configuration, and end-to-end connectivity testing between PCs, servers, and the simulated internet.
## What I Built
- VLAN 1: Inside (PC1 and Switch)
- VLAN 2: Server (Database Server)
- ASA Firewall with NAT Configuration
- Router simulating internet
- ACLs controlling traffic between internal, DMZ, and external
## Challenges I Faced
Couldn‚Äôt configure IP on cloud: forced me to redesign
DHCP errors on ASA: had to delete the pool and assign IPs manually
No IP assignment GUI on ASA: I had to use the CLI for everything
Access-lists: kept giving duplicate warnings until I cleaned them properly
PC1 Not Pinging the DB Server: Although I was confident that my VLAN setup and IP assignments were correct, PC1 was still unable to ping the DB Server. I guess it's because the NAT rule was not applying to the external ASA
Confusing layout at first: needed a diagram to visualise better
NAT to Internet Still Incomplete: Although NAT rules were added, I haven‚Äôt completed a full test of outbound internet access (PC1 ‚Üí Internet). This is because I focused more on resolving internal connectivity issues first.
## Lessons Learned
- VLAN interface names must be configured, not physical Ethernet interfaces directly.
- Every interface connected to a VLAN must be assigned properly on the ASA.
- ASA requires VLANs for nameif, not physical ports.
- Even if "up" shows, protocol can still be down if cables/interfaces are wrong.

- `network-assignment.pkt` ‚Äì the full Packet Tracer simulation file
- `network-diagram.png` ‚Äì screenshot of the topology
- `README.md` ‚Äì this documentation
  ## üß† Next Steps
  Create separate VLANs for each PC (e.g., HR, Finance)
Implement proper ACLs: Only specific traffic is allowed
Reconfigure NAT rule for internet access from user PCs
Add a backup router or ASA (failover path)
Include basic Syslog or SNMP to simulate monitoring
Use object-group-based ACLs instead of ‚Äúany any‚Äù
Add static routes to test route learning and control
